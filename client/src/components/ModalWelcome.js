            <p>Hello, and thank you for choosing Phree-OS. </p>

            <p>We aim to provide an easy, inexpensive point of sales solution for little businesses that can't afford the big, expensive point of sales systems. 
            Phree-OS is easy to use and manage, and charges nothing (at the moment*), giving you more time to concentrate on the things that matter, like running your business.</p>

            <p>Phree-OS utilizes Stripe to process securely all of your credit card transactions. After signing up for <a href="https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ca_FN84BX4d5t3AWVetDulOzof3z7ADKrM8&scope=read_write" onClick={props.close}>Stripe</a>, you'll be one of millions of business owners, 
            in more than 100 countries, who get to take advantage of their system.  For just 2.9% of each transaction total plus an additional $0.30, Stripe gives you access to your own personal dashboard, 
            where you can track your sales and watch your business grow.</p>

            <p>Sign up for Stripe, set up your store, and enjoy Phree-OS.</p>
