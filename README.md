After you've signed up, you're presented with this message, which instructs you to sign up for Stripe. From this link you may either sign in with your pre-existing Stripe account, or create a new one.

We rely on Stripe to process all credit card transactions for our customers.  No matter what, they only charge %2.9 + $0.30 for each transaction, which we think is a pretty good deal.

After your account Stripe account is set up its time to start setting up your store.

Its as easy as clicking on the manager tab in the top left corner, adding a category, then adding your items with the quantity you have in stock and the amount you'd like to sell it for. 

Add as many items as you'd like, then switch to the store page to start selling them! Selling items is just as easy adding them to our database.  You're given a representation of what your stock will be once this sale is complete, and a very clean and easy to read receipt with the quantity and total price for each item, and the grand total at the bottom.
